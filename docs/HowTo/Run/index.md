# How To Run #

To make a great project, we try our best to support developers work no matter what platform they are using, such as Windows and Linux, Runing Ghost Bird OS needs steps as follow:

1. Get a stable version of source(release better).
2. Install toolchain, virtual macthine and some other tools you need.
3. Prepare virtual image.
4. Compile the code.

## Get a stable version of source ##

You can easily download and participate in the development of Ghost Bird Operating System Project by the following way:

- visited our developer website:[makeos.org](http://makeos.org)
- follow us on github:[GhostBirdOS](https://github.com/GhostBirdOperatingSystemProject/GhostBirdOS)

In the above site, you can download source code or clone repository to the local(Check [here](https://help.github.com/categories/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/ "Creating, cloning, and archiving repositories") to learn more about repository), if this step is done, the GhostBirdOS directory will be like this(or may be more files):

![Source](Source.PNG "My local repository on Windows 7")

*My local repository on Windows 7*

**NOTE:** this is the root of GhostBirdOS project.

## Install everything you need ##

We need to use a lot of tools to help us read, write and debug our OS. For example, we need an excllent **code editor** which support highlight and some other extensions to make our develop comfortably, some free license **compiler** and tools to compile, link our C\C++\Assembly language code, after that, we need load our OS files into a virtual image, Ghost Bird File System Reader(or **gfr**) is required, then we need a convenient **virtual machine** to run our system, we can find out some problems, if there are some problem we can't figure out, maybe we need analyze some binary files through **hex editor**, or reverse Engineering through **disassembler**. Notice that it is possible that some compilers are a collection of tool chains(eg. GCC compiler). Besides, A kind of Markdown reader is necessary.
